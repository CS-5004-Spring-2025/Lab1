<hr/>

## Part 1 - Set up your Java environment

The [Resources](https://github.com/CS-5004-Spring-2025/Resources) repository has a README with many links you will find useful. It is advised that you plan to use IntelliJ for your assignments. 

## Part 2 - Set up GitHub

Make sure you have created a new user account at [GitHub.com](https://github.com/). 

Set up your computer to access your user account on GitHub. There are *many* ways to upload your work to GitHub, and we will demonstrate how to do this through IntelliJ. You will eventually need to learn to use git from the [command line](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-The-Command-Line). You may also wish to download [GitHub Desktop](https://github.com/apps/desktop) instead.

## Part 3 - Complete the code described in the starter Java files in your Lab 1 repository

### Car.java

- Declare data members for model, year, and mileage.
- Complete the constructor.
- Complete getters for the model, year, and mileage.
- Complete the `drive` method. This will update the mileage apprpriately.
- Complete the `toString` method.

### CarDriver.java
Complete the TODO items in the `main` method in the CarDriver.java file located in `app/src/main/java/car` by instantiating three `Car` objects and calling the `toString` method to print the contents of each.

### CarTest.java
